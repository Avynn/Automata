Automata

An attempt to make a visual lisp style language.

This is a little side project I'm putting together.  I want to make
a program that can create written code through the use of closures that
will be represented on the screen as nodes with inputs (arguments) and outputs
(result of the evaluated closure).  The intended use is to create a visual 
"playground" for functional programming so that it's easier for me to understand
the code that I write.

I'm doing this project mostly for my own understanding, I doubt that this
project will have much actual practical use.

Goals(long term):
->create a graph based system for coding and debugging
->Be able to translate between code and visual counterparts

Goals for version(0.0.1):
->Have a prototype object to begin testing
  How to represent a closure in memory

->Create some basic assets for UI
